# GoChan

Download images from 4chan  

### Features
1. Download all the images from a 4chan forum.
2. No dependincies, no extra modules required.

### Building From the source
1. Ensure your go version >= 1.16
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/DaKidReturns/GoChan`
3. Go into the folder GoChan `$ cd GoChan` and run `go build`

### Future Plans
1. [ ] Add a progress bar to show the currently downloading image
2. [ ] Currently it saves the pictures to the Directory `(HOME)/Pictures/Gochan` and takes only one command line argument  
3. [ ] I plan to do something with concurrency in golang, like download multiple files at once. (after I learn concurrency in golang)
4. [ ] Create better Documentation
5. [ ] Add a Logging feature

### Why did I do this?
1. I wanted to learn golang
2. I wanted to download all the images from a forum on 4chan [the one that contains a lot of technical drawings][4chanLink]


So I figured why not create a web scaper for it ;-)
