# GoChan

Download images from 4chan  

### Features
1. Download all the images from a 4chan forum.
2. No dependincies, no extra modules required.


### Future Plans
1. [ ] Add a progress bar to show the currently downloading image
2. [ ]  Currently it saves the pictures to the Directory `(HOME)/Pictures/Gochan` and takes only one command line argument  
3. [ ] I plan to do somthing with concurrency in golang, like download multiple files at once. (after I learn concurrency in golang)


### Why did I do this?
1. I wanted to learn golang
2. I wanted to download all the images from a forum on 4chan ([the one that contains a lot of technical drawings][4chanlink])

So I figured why not create a web scaper for it ;-)
